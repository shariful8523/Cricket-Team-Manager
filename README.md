Project Name
Cricket Team Manager

Brief Description
The Cricket Team Manager is a React-based application that allows users to build their own cricket team by selecting players from a list of available candidates. With a coin-based budget system, users can strategically add players, ensuring they stay within budget. The app features an intuitive UI for selecting and managing players, handling validations, and updating the team roster dynamically.

Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and managing component states.
React-Toastify: For delivering notifications and user feedback.
JSON: For storing and retrieving player data.
Tailwind CSS (or another styling approach): For consistent styling following Figma designs.

Key Features
Player Selection: Users can select cricket players from a list, each with a unique role, country, and bidding price. Selected players are dynamically updated in the team roster.
Budget Validation: Coins are required to select players. If the userâ€™s budget is insufficient, they receive an alert.
Player Selection Cap: Only up to 6 players can be selected. Attempts to add more show a notification.
Remove Functionality: Players can be removed from the team, restoring their bidding price to the budget.
Responsive UI: Follows a mobile-first approach with a responsive design based on Figma layouts.
Toggle Between Sections: Users can view available players or selected players using the toggle button.
Add Coins Feature: Users can add coins to increase their budget.
Newsletter and Footer: Styled sections matching Figma's design to complete the user experience.
